TODO: Restore Advanced Requests Functionality


1. Player Request Queue UI
   - Render a queue UI below (or above) the chat input, inside the chat sidebar.
   - Each request in the queue should display:
     - The player's name and image (configurable: token, avatar, etc.)
     - The request's importance level (Common, Important, Urgent), visually distinct.
   - Provide buttons for players to add a request at any level.

2. Request Management
   - Players can remove their own requests by clicking (LMB or RMB).
   - GMs can remove any request with RMB, or "activate" a request with LMB (triggers a sound and chat message).

3. Custom Images
   - Allow players to choose the image used for their request (token, avatar, etc.) via settings.
   - If no image is found, prompt the user to set one.

4. Movable/Detachable Window
   - Allow the request queue to be moved from under the chat to a free position on the screen (via settings or Shift+LMB).
   - Provide a button to return the queue to its default position.
   - Allow resizing the queue window via settings.

5. Synchronization
   - All requests and queue changes should be synchronized across all clients (using SocketLib).

6. Accessibility
   - Ensure the UI is accessible and visually clear for all users.
   - GM should be able to customise an audio sound for each category of request.

Implementation Notes:
- Use the same UI look, DOM placement and CSS structure as dice-calculator for the default (above chat message input) position.
- Use a single source of truth for the queue (e.g., a setting or in-memory object, synchronized via SocketLib). Copy `raise-my-hand`'s Implementation
- Modularize the code so the queue UI and logic can be reused regardless of UI state:  both docked and floating modes. 
- add options to match notification features of `raise-my-hand`
